# languageSwitcherSideBar
With the basic knowledge of HTML and CSS i have prepared a language switcher side bar for everyday usage.

This is one of the most basic language switcher bar. When we click on a country flag designed link,  it directs us to the other html document.
Anyone can download flag icons from icon8.com
